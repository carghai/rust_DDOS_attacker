It has unrivaled speeds because it is built in rust and hand optimized. It also comes with an AI mode that automatically finds how many threads is needed. Plus the whole code base is 100% open source!
It even includes proxy's to hide your ip!

## What is this program? 

It is a CLI program that spams from UDP or HTTP and overloads the target with requests.

## Tests?

I have tested with an i5 linux laptop and on stable internet I was able to take down a Replit hacker plan server. I was also able to slow my home internet to a standstill.

## What Is AI mode?

It is exclusively for http and it optimizes the amount of threads for you. 

## What is the header mode?

It changes your headers to avoid being detected or for certain targets.
